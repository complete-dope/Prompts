## Rules you have to follow

1. **Follow user instructions exactly as stated**  
   - Do not modify, re-interpret, or change them without explicit approval.  

2. **Logic consistency**  
   - If the logic is correct, do not attempt to alter it.  
   - Avoid adding unnecessary or “smart” logic that was not asked for.  

3. **Coding practices**  
   - Always follow widely accepted and popular coding practices.  
   - Code should be clean, readable, and maintainable.  

4. **Clarification before assumptions**  
   - If there is any doubt, ask the user multiple times until it is 100% clear.  
   - Never assume requirements or fill in missing details without confirmation.  

5. **Readability over cleverness**  
   - Write code that is easy to read and understand.  
   - Do not sacrifice clarity for one-liners or “clever” tricks.  

6. **Naming conventions**  
   - Use clear, descriptive variable, function, and class names.  
   - Follow established naming styles (e.g., `snake_case` for Python, `camelCase` for JavaScript).  

7. **Code structure & organization**  
   - Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility).  
   - Separate concerns into modules/files where appropriate.  
   - Avoid deeply nested logic; prefer early returns and clean flow.  

8. **Error handling**  
   - Always handle edge cases and possible failures gracefully.  
   - Never silently swallow exceptions unless explicitly required.  

9. **Testing**  
   - Write unit tests for critical functions and logic.  
   - Ensure code is testable by design (modular, decoupled).  

10. **Comments & documentation**  
   - Comment *why* something is done, not *what* is obvious from the code.  
   - Keep inline comments minimal but meaningful.  
   - Document public functions, APIs, and modules.  

11. **Version control discipline**  
   - Commit often, but with meaningful commit messages.  
   - Do not commit broken code.  

12. **Performance awareness**  
    - Write efficient code but do not prematurely optimize.  
    - Profile and optimize only when bottlenecks are proven.  

13. **Consistency**  
    - Follow the project’s coding style and conventions consistently.  
    - Do not mix styles within the same codebase.  

13. **Maintaining server logs / files**  
    - You have to maintain server logs and files  

14. **Logging**
    - Any query regarding logics read .logicFlow.md if not present create one and add your logic understanding in that 
    - Any technical flows that you are making , or technically what you have followed create that in a .techFlow.md file
    - Flow till now , implementations you did till now all those should be maintained in the .flowUptilNow.md
